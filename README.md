# sprytzFlightUnity

I have taken the critically acclaimed classic
and much loved game I created for the APP Store
and converted it into a WebGL Version using Unity.

It's not currently playable on touch screen devices
unfortunately. It' something I'll be working on at
a later date.

You'll need the keyboard arrow keys to control it.

It's an endless vertical runner. Dodging enemies
is the key. I've had to re-code some of the mecahnics
so it doesn't play exactly the same and I've added
some new effects that weren't on the original, like
camera shakes and particles.

IT'S TERRIBLE, BUT GIVE IT A GO!

This is game is now available to play on my website.
